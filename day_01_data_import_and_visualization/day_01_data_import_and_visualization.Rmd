# psychology example 1

> (Adapted from Maxwell & Delaney, 1990, p 300, quest #9) A clinical psychologist wants to compare three types of therapy for snake phobia. However, she does not believe that one type of therapy is necessarily best for everyone; the best therapy may depend on the severity level of the client's phobia. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology course were given a Fear Inventory to screen out subjects showing no fear of snakes. Those displaying some degree of snake phobia were classified as either mildly or severely phobic. Subjects were then randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: systematic desensitization, implosive therapy, or insight therapy. The following data are from a well-accepted phobia scale (higher scores indicate less phobia). You don't need to know anything about the conceptual differences between these three therapies or the phobia scale to answer the following questions. To save time, no need to check assumptions for this problem set but don't skip this step when you analyze real data in your research.

```{r}

# source example data
source("example_tidy_data/snake_phobia.R")

# view descriptives for snake therapy data
snk_thrpy_desc

```

## plot means from table of descriptives

```{r}

ggplot(data = snk_thrpy_desc, aes(x = therapy, y = mean_phobia, fill = severity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
  geom_errorbar(mapping = aes(ymin = mean_phobia - moe_phobia, ymax = mean_phobia + moe_phobia), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), width = 0.1)

```

## plot means from raw data

```{r}

ggplot(data = snakes_therapy, aes(x = therapy, y = phobia, fill = severity)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", geom = "bar", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", geom = "errorbar", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), width = 0.1)

# psychology example 2

> adapted from figure 1 from Tybur et al. (2016)

* The scatterplot displays the relationship between national parasite stress and traditionalism (r = 0.70). Each data point [labeled with a two-letter country code (abbreviations defined in Table 1)] represents a nation's mean traditionalism, controlling for sample demographic characteristics (age and sex).
* To facilitate visual interpretation of results (Figs. 1–3), we added a constant to each nation’s parasite stress score so that the lowest scoring country (Canada) had a value of zero.
